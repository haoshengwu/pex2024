The student should finished the project independently. The project will be finished by the Jupyter Nootbook with the Python Kernel. The explanations/analysis are also directly presented in the Jupyter Nootbook. The project will be submitted by the PDF file, which is directly transformed from the Jupyter Nootbook file. It means all the source codes and the analysis will be togther evaluated by Prof. Subba.</p>

<p>The teachers (Haosheng Wu and Prof. Fabio Subba) will provied the 5 topics with different Tokamak devices. Every topic is the cutting-edge research work, which means it is the real research in the edge plasma comumunity.</p>

<p>Although the topic is challanging, I hope you can experience the feelling of real research!</p>

<h3 id="title">Title:</h3>

<h4 id="comparion-between-solps-iter-simulations-with-the-two-point-models-for-eu-demo-dtt-divertor-regimes">Comparion between SOLPS-ITER simulations with the Two-Point models for EU-DEMO (DTT) divertor regimes.</h4>

<h3 id="problem-to-solve">Problem to Solve:</h3>

<p>DTT is under construcntion and aiming to be operated in the detachment regime.</p>

<blockquote class="block-tip">
  <h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

  <p>We already discussed the divertor regimes: low recycling regime, high recycling regime and the detachment.
The key parameters for 2PM is the density, connection length, temperature. How can we make a connection between them?</p>

<h2 id="project-two">Project Two</h2>

<h3 id="title-1">Title:</h3>

<h4 id="evaluation-the-dtt-divertor-performan-with-the-argon-and-neon-impurity-seeding">Evaluation the DTT divertor performan with the Argon and Neon impurity seeding</h4>

<h3 id="problem-to-solve-1">Problem to Solve:</h3>

<p>Impurity seeding are necessary for future tokamak high power scenario operation.</p>

<blockquote class="block-tip">
  <h3 id="hints-1">Hints</h3>

  <p>The atom number for Neon is 10, it means there are 10 (DIECI) types Neon ions from Neon+ to Neon10+.
For Argon, the atom number is 18, it means there are (DICIOTTO) types Aron ions from Argon+ to Argon18+.</p>

<h2 id="project-three">Project Three</h2>

<h3 id="title-2">Title:</h3>

<h4 id="comparison-between-solps-iter-and-the-lengyel-model-for-dtt-n-seeding-plasma">Comparison between SOLPS-ITER and the Lengyel Model for DTT N seeding plasma</h4>

<h3 id="problem-to-solve-2">Problem to Solve:</h3>

<p>For full impurity model in SOLPS simulations, the running time is too long. There are simple models to predict.
We need to figure out their performance.</p>

<blockquote class="block-tip">
  <h3 id="hints-2">Hints</h3>

  <p>Please remember that in Edge Plasma simulatation, there is alway not accuarate match between Experimens, CODES.
Even the different codes with the same physical models.</p>

<h2 id="project-four">Project Four</h2>

<h3 id="title-3">Title:</h3>

<h4 id="comparison-between-solps-iter-and-s-i-krasheninnikovs-detachment-model-for-asdex-upgrade">Comparison between SOLPS-ITER and S. I. Krasheninnikov’s detachment model for ASDEX-Upgrade</h4>

<h3 id="problem-to-solve-3">Problem to Solve:</h3>

<p>Different with the 2PM, there is another detachment model which is proposed by S. I. Krasheninnikov’s.
In this project, the SOLPS AUG simulations, which have been well validated agasinst experimental datat, 
will be compared with the S. I. Krasheninnikov’s detachment model.</p>

<blockquote class="block-tip">
  <h3 id="hints-3">Hints</h3>

  <p>For S. I. Krasheninnikov’s detachment model, the key paramters are no longer the upstream conditions, 
but are ***, you should think about how to extract/get such values based on current simulation.</p>

<h3 id="title-4">Title:</h3>

<h4 id="evaluate-the-momumtum-loss-and-energy-loss-along-flux-tube-for-eu-demo--dtt">Evaluate the momumtum loss and energy loss along flux tube for EU-DEMO / DTT.</h4>

<h3 id="problem-to-solve-4">Problem to Solve:</h3>

<p>Evaluate the momumtum loss and energy loss in different divertor regimes</p>

<blockquote class="block-tip">
  <h3 id="hints-4">Hints</h3>

  <p>We now focuse the plasma parameters instead of radial profiles.</p>

<p>Five projects related to power exhaust modelling are provided. Each project is derived from the ongoing research projects. After the whole workshop, each student will be randomly assigned ONE of the five project. Each project contains several sub-questions. The students are expected to answer these equstions independently.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do">How to do?</h2>

<p>During the Hand-on sessions, the students will perform physical analysis related to the power exhaust modelling. Similarly, for the final project, students will perform physical analysis to address the sub-questions of each project. A Jupyter notebook template for each project will be provided in the Docker image, where students will perform their analysis and answer the sub-questions.</p>

<p>For each project, a final report is need to be submitted. The report will be created by the student’s Jupyter notebook file that directly by ‘save as PDF’ botton. In another word, all the analysis process, e.g. related python scripts, and answers will be together presented. The final report will be evaluated by Prof. Subba.</p>

<p>The final report can be send to Prof. Subba by email fabio.subba@polito.it</p>

<h2 id="when-to-do">When to do?</h2>

<p>The deadline for sumbiting the report is ????.??.??</p>
