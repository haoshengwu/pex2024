## What to Do?

Five projects related to power exhaust modelling are provided. Each project is derived from the ongoing research projects. After the whole workshop, each student will be randomly assigned ONE of the five project. Each project contains several sub-questions. The students are expected to answer these equstions independently. 

## How to do?

During the Hand-on sessions, the students will perform physical analysis related to the power exhaust modelling. Similarly, for the final project, students will perform physical analysis to address the sub-questions of each project. A Jupyter notebook template for each project will be provided in the Docker image, where students will perform their analysis and answer the sub-questions.

For each project, a final report is need to be submitted. The report will be created by the student's Jupyter notebook file that directly by 'save as PDF' botton. In another word, all the analysis process, e.g. related python scripts, and answers will be together presented. The final report will be evaluated by Prof. Subba.

The final report can be send to Prof. Subba by email fabio.subba@polito.it
