## Welcome

Welcome to the EXhasut (**PEX**) Modelling Workshop 2024, which is the practical part of Nuclear Fusion Reactor Physics (**NFRP**) A.A. 2024/2025. 

The main aim of this workshop is to bridge the gap between the edge plasma physics, which is introduced from NRRP lectures by Prof. Subba, and the cutting-edge research, e.g. the power exhaust problem for tokamak. 

This workshop consists of three segments, each including a lecture part (~1 hour) and a Hands-on session (~1.5 hour). In the lecture part, the edge plasma physics is introduced.  In the hands-on session, students, together with Dr. Haosheng Wu, will carry out practical exercises related to edge plasma modelling based on the cutting-edge research. An additional Preparation session is also provided that help the students install necessary materials/softwares, which are used in this workshop.

After this workshop, every student will be assigned ONE of FIVE projects, which they are expected to complete independently. All the necessary knowledges and tools are provided is this workshop. More detals about the finnal project can be found in the Final Project page.

Any questions/suggestions/feedbacks are welcome and please feel free to contact haosheng.wu@polito.it .

## Prerequisite

1. Basic knowledge about edge plasma physics, which is introduced by Prof. Subba in NFRP lecutres, is essential before attending this workshop. 

2. In the workshop, there are Hand-on sessions for students. A Laptop with Windows system is prefered. All the materials has been tested in the Windows systems. If you use Mac, please let me (Haosheng Wu) know.

3. In the Hand-on sessions, the practices are based on [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) with [Python](https://www.python.org/) kernel. Python at a fundamental level is required. If you are a new user of Python, an quick introduction to Python can be found [Here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/6/).

4. All the nessary materials, e.g. simulation data, numerical tool, softwares, Python environment etc., for the Hand-on sessions are provided by A [Docker](https://www.docker.com) imange. Before the first segment of the workshop, the installation of the materials are provied in the Preparation session.
